<h2><a name="Bruce_Barnett" href="About.html#TOC">Bruce Barnett</a></h2>
<p>
For 27 years, Bruce Barnett worked at GE's Global Research Center in upstate New York.
He was responsible for finding solutions for business- and military-related
problems when no commercial solution existed. Bruce was the primary
expert in security and networking for GE's research facility. His
customers were GE's business divisions, such as Healthcare, NBC,
Digital Energy, Oil and Gas. Bruce also developed several
security-based solutions for Lockheed Martin.
<p>Bruce has the
ability to quickly research existing approaches, devise innovative
solutions, master new technology, and rapidly prototype new
technology that both demonstrates new capability while creating a
solution that is practical. These projects often required interfacing
to existing systems, including databases, web servers, etc.

  <p>Bruce published 27 papers, and was awarded 14 patents. He taught
classes in security. He won 10 management awards from GE and 2 from
Lockheed Martin. He has proven skills in communication.</P>

<P>In addition, Bruce was involved in
many product risk assessments, and performed technological reviews of
technology with security requirements.
  <p>Bruce's first job at GE
was a senior system administrator, responsible for more than 1000
Unix workstations, while maintaining hundreds of open-source software
packages for the research community. Bruce connected GE to the
Internet in 1988, and was promoted to a scientist because of his
expertise.
  <p>Before Bruce joined GE, he was a senior software
engineer for 13 years, working for a small company making circuit
board test systems, and was the primary developer of the run-time and
user interface software. He also created a 50-workstation network and
transitioned the company to Unix-based systems. This experience
shaped Bruce's attitude, which stresses the importance of creating
reliable and maintainable software.
<p>Bruce's strengths include:</P>

<h2><a name="What_is_a_Grymoire" href="About.html#TOC">What is a Grymoire</a></h2>
<p>A Grimoire is a notebook used by wizards. It is a collection of
incantations, spells, and information. It seemed like a suitable name
for a personal workstation. I changed the spelling (I was influenced
by T. A. Waters) to Grymoire, and I have used that name for my
computer since 1986.
